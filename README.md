# Gemini-Voice-Assistant

## About the App
This Chatbot & Voice Assistant is powered by Python, Google Generative AI, Flask, and JavaScript.
By leveraging the Google Gemini model, I created a fun interface that allows for users to talk to the Gemini model as well as ask it questions as you would a regular chat bot!
